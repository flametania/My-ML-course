# My-ML-course
Here are some practical materials I work out for the corresponding discipline (mostly for ML cource 3rd year Bachelor degree students of our university)/

It includes following topics:
* Visual analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, WordCloud)
* EDA theory
* Preprocessing (Pandas functions, Scikit-learn pipelines)
* Clustering (Scikit-learn clustering methods, visualization, string similarity calculation)

The most part of the topics include hometasks and tests.
